User Authentication and Management System

This project is a user authentication and management system with a graphical user interface designed using QT Designer. 
It provides the following features:

-Checks for the existence of a user database and creates one if none is found.
-Allows users to log in with a username and password, implementing a lockout mechanism after three failed attempts.
-Includes a registration function with validation to prevent duplicate or incomplete entries.
-Features buttons to connect to GitHub, LinkedIn, open an Outlook mail, and access a personal CV.

The GUI was designed in QT Designer, and the program utilizes PyQt5 for GUI development and SQL Server Management Studio for database operations. It also integrates web and email functionalities.

Warning: Please note that the server name in the authentication page should be changed according to the user's server.

Feel free to customize the content as per your requirements.
